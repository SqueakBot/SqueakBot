## Squeakbot

***[Explain your app, should be at least a paragraph. What does it do? Why should I use? Sell your product!]***
Squeakbot is a helpful mock interviewer for the phase of your life when you are practicing common whiteboard questions in preparation for job interviews in the tech industry. It uses AI technology and a raspberry pi zero to listen to your request and output a question. When you ask it, "Give me a challenge," it will recieve your request through a microphone on a voice bonnet. Using a Node Server, it pulls a random question from a SQL database and reads it out loud to you through a speaker.
