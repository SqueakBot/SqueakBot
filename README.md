## Squeakbot

Squeakbot is a helpful mock interviewer for the phase of your life when you are practicing common whiteboard questions 
in preparation for job interviews in the tech industry. It uses AI technology and a raspberry pi zero to listen to your 
request and output a question. When you ask it, "Give me a challenge," it will receive your request through a microphone
on a voice bonnet. Using a Node Server, it pulls a random question from a SQL database and reads it out loud to you through a speaker.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
<!-- $ git clone https://github.com/SqueakBot/SqueakBot -->
```
Once downloaded, you can either use Visual Studio 2017 (or greater) to build the web application.
```
cd SqueakBot/SqueakBot
`npm i`
```
Install all dependencies needed for the project.
```
PostgresQL Database
* CREATE DATABASE squeakbot
* `psql -f <schema.sql> -d <squeakbot>`
* How this Database works:
  * There are three seperate tables in this database: User, Challenges, Test
    * User:
      * Every user has a serial primary id that is generated by postgres
      * When every user signs up, they are required to provide an username, email and password which are saved to the database
        * The password that is saved to the database is a hashed password
    * Challenges
      * Everything that is in the challenges table are inserted into the table within the schema file
        * The rows that are in the table are as follows:
          1. Challenges (Individual White Board Challenge)
          2. Data Type, this is the datatype that is being used for each challenge
          3. Hint, this is a hint for the user to have if they get stuck with whiteboard question
    * Test
      * Everything that is in the challenges table are inserted into the table within the schema file
        * The primary key for tests is the same as the primary key for challenges that way when a random challenge is generated the user can get the test for that challenge
        * Input Row
          * This row is what the users input should be for the whiteboard challenge that they get from SqueakBot
        * Output Row
          * This row is what the users output should be after they are done with their whiteboard challenges
```
Create a .env file
* Define a PORT
* Add your Database URL: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/squeakbot
* For more details see section titled: 
```
cd SqueakBot/SqueakBot
`npm start ` OR `nodemon`
```
